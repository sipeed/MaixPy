## About TTS

TTS (Text-to-Speech) converts text into speech. You can write a piece of text and feed it to a TTS-supported model. After running the model, it will output an audio data containing the spoken version of the text.
In practice, TTS is commonly used for video dubbing, navigation guidance, public announcements, and more. Simply put, TTS is “technology that reads text aloud.”

## MeloTTS

The usage of MeloTTS can be found in [MeloTTS Text to Speech Model](../mllm/tts_melotts.md).
