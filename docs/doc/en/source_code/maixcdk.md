title: MaixCAM Switching to MaixCDK for C/C++ Application Development
---

In addition to developing with MaixPy, there is also a corresponding C/C++ SDK available, called [MaixCDK](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixCDK).

## Introduction to MaixCDK

MaixPy is built on top of MaixCDK, and most of MaixPy's APIs are automatically generated based on MaixCDK's APIs. Therefore, any functionality available in MaixPy is also included in MaixCDK.
If you are more familiar with C/C++ programming or require higher performance, you can use MaixCDK for development.

## Using MaixCDK

The MaixCDK code repository is located at [github.com/sipeed/MaixCDK](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixCDK), where you can find the MaixCDK code and documentation.
