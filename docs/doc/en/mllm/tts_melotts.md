## Introduction

MeloTTS is a high-quality multilingual text-to-speech library jointly developed by MIT and MyShell.ai. Currently, it supports the mellotts-zh model, which can synthesize both Chinese and English speech. However, English synthesis is not yet optimal.

The default output audio is PCM data with a sample rate of 44100 Hz, single channel, and 16-bit depth.

> Sample rate: The number of times sound is sampled per second.
>
> Channels: The number of audio channels captured per sample. Single channel means mono audio, and dual channel means stereo (left and right channels). To reduce AI inference complexity, single-channel audio is generally used.
>
> Bit depth: The data range captured per sample. A 16-bit depth usually represents each sample as a 16-bit signed integer. Higher bit depth captures finer audio details.

## Downloading the Model

Supported models:

| Model                                                         | Platform     | Memory Requirement | Description              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| [melotts-maixcam2](https://huggingface.co/sipeed/melotts-maixcam2) | MaixCAM2 | 1G      | base |

Refer to the [Large Model User Guide](./basic.md) to download the model.

## Running the Model with MaixPy

```python
from maix import nn, audio

# Only MaixCAM2 supports this model.
sample_rate = 44100
p = audio.Player(sample_rate=sample_rate)
p.volume(80)

melotts = nn.MeloTTS(model="/root/models/melotts-maixcam2/melotts-zh.mud", speed = 0.8, language='zh')

pcm = melotts.infer('你好', output_pcm=True)
p.play(pcm)
```
Notes：
1. Import the nn module first to create a MeloTTS model object:
```python
from maix import nn
```
2. Choose the model to load. currently, the melotts-zh model is supported:
   - `speed` sets the playback speed
   - `language` sets the language type
```python
melotts = nn.MeloTTS(model="/root/models/melotts/melotts-zh.mud", speed = 0.8, language='zh')
```
3. Start inference:
   - The text to infer here is 'hello'
   - Set `output_pcm=True` to return PCM data
```python
pcm = melotts.infer('hello', output_pcm=True)
```
4. Use the audio playback module to play the generated audio:
   - Make sure the sample rate matches the model’s output
   - Use `p.volume(80)` to control the output volume (range: 0–100)
   - Play the PCM generated by MeloTTS with `p.play(pcm)`
```shell
p = audio.Player(sample_rate=sample_rate)
p.volume(80)
p.play(pcm)
```
